298203c  "best" set of nuclear properties for those nuclides reported between   
298204c  A=266 and A=294 based on data currently available and {bnot} to

29820 c  2009Og02: Attempt at direct synthesis using the reaction               
29820ac  {+244}Pu({+58}Fe,4n) at E{-Lab}=330.4 MeV corresponding to an          
29820ac  excitation energy of E{+*}=45.5 MeV in the compound system. An         
29820ac  E{-ex}=40 to 45 MeV was expected to provide the optimum yield for both 
29820ac  the 3n ({+299}120) and 4n channels. The                                
29820ac  experiment was performed at Dubna from January to March 2007 using     
29820ac  the U400 cyclotron and the DGFRS apparatus. The detection efficiency   
29820ac  for full energy |a particles was 87%. A total beam dose of             
29820ac  7.1x10{+18} {+58}Fe ions was accumulated. The sensitivity of the       
29820ac  experiment corresponded to 0.4 pb for the one-event cross-section. The 
29820ac  range for the 84% upper limit cross-section was 0.7 pb                 
29820ac  (only statistical                                                      
29820ac  uncertainties) to 1.1 pb (including other experimental uncertainties). 
29820ac  The tof of the recoils to the focal plane of the separator was about   
29820ac  1 |msec. The experimenters state that this is shorter than the         
29820ac  half-lives predicted for the |a-decay of                               
29820ac  {+299}120 and {+298}120 as listed in Table 1,                          
29820ac  assuming that |a emission is the preferred decay mode.                 
29820ac  It would be therefore be reasonable to assume that the entire decay    
29820ac  chain would be registered in the focal plane detectors. Daughter decays
29820ac  were expected to be detected during a 30 sec beam off interval         
29820ac  triggered by a recoil signal within the energy range of 6.5 to 18.5    
29820ac  MeV.                                                                   
29820 c  No correlated EVR-|a or EVR-SF events were detected in either the      
29820ac  beam off or beam on condition, which could be attributed to this       
29820ac  nucleus within the stated experimental sensitivity of 0.4 pb           
29820ac  corresponding to the one-event cross-section.
